# ALPAR AI — Claude Context File

## Project

ALPAR AI — Trust infrastructure for AI accountability. Next.js 15 + Supabase + Tailwind v4 + next-intl. AGPL-3.0.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev              # next dev
pnpm build            # next build
pnpm lint             # eslint + tsc --noEmit
pnpm test             # vitest
pnpm test:e2e         # playwright
pnpm db:migrate       # supabase migration up
```

## Conventions

- **TypeScript strict** — `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` enabled. No `any` — use `unknown` + Zod.
- **No comments** in code.
- **Server Actions** for mutations — never `supabase.from().insert()` from the client.
- **RLS** — every table has policies. Admin client only for moderation/audit.
- **PII Guardian** — every user free-text is masked before insert (`src/lib/pii/guardian.ts`).
- **i18n** — `messages/{en,tr}.json`. Use `useTranslations("namespace")` / `getTranslations({locale, namespace})`. **Admin panels (authorization-gated): EN/TR only** — no DE/FR/RU needed for `/admin/*` routes. Public-facing pages (`/insights`, `/community`, `/documentation`) require all 5 languages.
- **Tailwind v4** — design tokens in `src/app/globals.css` (`@theme inline`). No `tailwind.config.ts`.

## Standing Rules

1. Read `docs/BOOTSTRAP.md` FIRST (~500 tokens).
2. Use graphify for architecture questions (`graphify query "..."`).
3. Never read files > 10KB directly; use graphify or line-limited views (max 100).
4. Never read `docs/MASTER-ANALYSIS*.md` (outdated).
5. Never log raw IP, email, or PII. Always hash.
6. Never expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to the browser.
7. Run `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck` after every change.
8. The Engineering Operating Standard in `AGENTS.md` is binding — read it.
9. **Model routing (token economy)** — delegate discovery to Haiku; never scan the codebase directly with an expensive model:

   | Work type                                                                                                      | Model                                          |
   | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
   | Code search, file location, inventory, grep/glob discovery, "where is X defined"                               | **Haiku** (Explore subagent, `model: "haiku"`) |
   | Routine/mechanical: translation fill-in, formatting, repetitive edits                                          | **Haiku**                                      |
   | Mechanical execution once a plan is approved: repo setup, file export/copy, secret-pattern scans, git plumbing | **Haiku**                                      |
   | Architecture decisions, strategy, security analysis, MASTER_PLAN authoring, multi-step reasoning               | **Opus 5 / Fable 5**                           |

   **TOM (Token Optimization Engine) — MASTER_PLAN doctrine entries:** Haiku drafts → Sonnet writes the full content → Stage-3 review by **Opus 5 or Fable 5** (approve or diff-sized patch on architecture/governance/security grounds; not a shared label — the two are separate reviewer options with different guardrails, MASTER_PLAN v11.16). Full rewrites at the review stage are prohibited — see G-4 in MASTER_PLAN v11.13 (amended v11.14): >30% longer than Sonnet's output = violation, applies to both. **Fable 5 additionally hard-caps its output at ~1000 tokens** regardless of that ratio (G-4b, MASTER_PLAN v11.15/v11.16); **Opus 5 is hard-capped at ~5000 tokens** (G-4c, MASTER_PLAN v11.17).

   **G-5 (binding):** Expensive-model sessions (Opus 5 / Fable 5) must delegate all sub-work — file reads, writes, research, discovery, grep — to Haiku; the expensive model reviews Haiku output and approves or patches at diff size only. The **Architect role** is scoped to MASTER_PLAN authorship; all implementation belongs to the **Implementer role** (Antigravity and OpenCode). Re-scoped v12.83 — see G-6a: the boundary is separation of duties, not model identity, since Antigravity runs Claude models too.

   **G-5 amendment (v12.46, data-driven):** Measured baseline (source: session transcript `~/.claude/projects/-home-user-Alparai-com/eae2cdac-*.jsonl`, real `usage` fields, 10,313 assistant turns) shows Sonnet 5 — not Opus 5 / Fable 5 — held the largest share of turns (56.6%) and output tokens (~5.47M), while Haiku 4.5 held the smallest (9.2% turns, ~0.56M output tokens) despite being the routing table's assigned model for discovery and mechanical work. **G-5's delegation mandate therefore binds Sonnet 5 sessions identically to Opus 5 / Fable 5**: any task matching a Haiku-row work type (code search, file location, inventory, grep/glob discovery, routine/mechanical execution) must first attempt a Haiku subagent (Explore or general-purpose, `model: "haiku"`). Direct execution by Sonnet/Opus/Fable requires a one-line logged exception in `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md` stating why delegation was not used. See MASTER_PLAN v12.46 for the full baseline figures.

   **G-5 delegation threshold (v12.48) — when NOT to delegate.** Delegation is not free: a subagent starts cold and re-derives context the caller already holds, so spawning one for a task the caller can finish in a few tool calls costs more than it saves. G-5 therefore binds **breadth**, not every task. Delegate when scope is unknown or spans many files — repo-wide discovery, "where is X defined", inventory sweeps, repetitive edits across many paths. Do **not** delegate when the file paths are already known and scope is 1–2 files, or when the work is analysis/computation over data already in the session's context (e.g. summing transcript `usage` fields into a cost table) — the caller executes those directly, and no logged exception is required. When the two rules appear to conflict, breadth decides: unknown scope → delegate; known narrow scope → execute. Mirrors the user-level TOM rule 2 (delegation threshold).

   **G-6 (binding — amended MASTER_PLAN v12.19 "enforcement exception", re-scoped v12.83 "role not model"):** The session acting in the **Architect role** — the session that authors `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`, i.e. this interactive Claude Code session — may not call `Write`/`Edit` or any mutating `git`/`pnpm`/`npm` command against application code (`src/**`), database migrations, or content files (`messages/**`, docs other than those below). **Permitted paths:** the three governance/doctrine files (`docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`) **plus the enforcement layer** — `.github/workflows/**`, `.husky/**`, `playwright.config.ts`, and dependency-security fields in `package.json` (`pnpm.overrides`, `overrides`). Rationale: Doctrine #047 requires every binding rule to ship with an executable enforcer; routing three lines of CI YAML through another agent is the exact round-trip the Founder identified as waste. Enforcement-layer edits must be verified by running the affected command (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, or the workflow's own command) before commit; a failing verification means revert, not "fix it next commit". Every fix or feature — however small — is written into MASTER_PLAN.md as a specification (exact file paths, exact schema/code) for the **Implementer role** (Antigravity/OpenCode) to implement. If a session catches itself mid-violation, it must stop, revert (`git checkout`/`rm`), and log the violation and correction as its own MASTER_PLAN section.

   **G-6a (why "role", not "Claude" — binding clarification, v12.83):** The earlier wording said "no Claude session, any tier". That is unenforceable and self-contradictory: **Antigravity runs Claude models too**, so under the literal old reading every Antigravity commit to `src/**` was a G-6 violation, which was never the intent. The boundary is about **separation of duties**, not model identity. Architect writes the specification and never the implementation; Implementer writes the implementation and never edits `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`. The `.husky/pre-commit` plan-guard (which blocks `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md` without `ARCHITECT=1`) enforces the Implementer half and is confirmed working — Antigravity hit it and correctly unstaged. The Architect half has no automated enforcer yet; see MASTER_PLAN #103.

   **G-7 (binding, v12.83) — "pushed or it did not happen".** No agent may report a task complete, or flip a `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md` backlog row to `✅ completed`, until the work is **on `origin`** and the reporting agent has re-read it from `origin` to confirm. A local commit is not completion. Reports must cite the commit SHA **and** the branch it was pushed to. Rationale: agents run in different working copies (Antigravity on the Founder's local machine at `d:\Alparai`, this session in a cloud container); a commit that exists in one checkout is invisible to every other agent and to the Founder's deployment. Verification by any reviewing session is defined as "visible on `origin`" — an agent claiming otherwise is reporting an unverifiable state.

   **G-8 (binding, v12.129, corrected v12.129.1) — Plan branch senkronizasyonu otomatik (PR üzerinden).** Mimar `claude/strategy-brief-review-i93xcv` branch'inde yazar; `.github/workflows/plan-branch-sync.yml` her push'ta bu branch'i, değişen dosyalar yalnızca `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` ise ve commit `[architect]` etiketi + allowlist'teki yazar kimliğini (`noreply@anthropic.com`) taşıyorsa `master`'a bir PR açar ve auto-merge talep eder (squash). **v12.129.1 düzeltmesi:** ilk tasarım doğrudan `git push origin master` yapıyordu; bu, `master`'ın ruleset korumasına (`Changes must be made through a pull request` + 7 zorunlu status check) çarpıp CI'da runner bile atanmadan anında başarısız oldu — yalnızca bypass yetkili kimlikler (ör. Mimar oturumunun kendi git kimliği) doğrudan push yapabiliyor, varsayılan Actions token'ı yapamıyor. Düzeltilmiş tasarım PR açıp `gh pr merge --auto` ile 7 kontrolün geçmesini bekler — ruleset'i atlamaz, onunla çalışır. Kod dosyası değişikliği varsa PR açılmaz, manuel inceleme gerekir. Gerekçe (v12.94–v12.111 kanıtı): otomasyonsuz 2-branch modeli branch'in haftalarca senkronsuz kalmasına ve 14 maddenin (#131–#144) Uygulayıcı tarafından hiç görülmemesine yol açmıştı; v12.112 bunu tek-branch (master) modeline geçerek geçici çözmüştü. Bu kural aynı ayrımı (git log'da Mimar/Uygulayıcı kaynağı net) korurken senkron kaybını yapısal olarak imkânsız kılar. Branch iki oturumdan fazla senkronsuz kalırsa (`git rev-list --left-right --count origin/master...origin/claude/strategy-brief-review-i93xcv` ile ölçülür) bu bir CI/süreç ihlali sayılır.

10. **No unsourced numbers in `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`** — every figure cites a file path, table name, or measurement. If unmeasured, write "ölçülmedi". Projections must be tagged `[tahmin — doğrulanmamış]`.

11. **Prompt normalization (binding, all sessions)** — The Founder writes in Turkish. Before acting on any Founder message, silently rewrite it into a precise professional English prompt (role, task, constraints, evidence rule), then execute that. Never print the rewritten prompt — it is internal working state, not output. **No exceptions clause (2026-08-02):** the Founder flagged that this rule exists but doesn't fire on every message. It applies to every Founder message without exception, including short ones, follow-ups, and messages sent while already mid-task — there is no message type that skips it. If a reply didn't visibly benefit from normalization, that is a sign the step was skipped, not a sign the message didn't need it.

12. **Reply style for the Founder (binding)** — Answer in flowing natural language, not numbered lists or item-ID tables. The Founder is human and does not carry item numbers in memory; refer to work by what it _does_ ("the nightly security scan"), not by its number. Keep replies short — the shortest form that is still honest and complete. Long structured reports belong in `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`, not in chat.

## Key Architecture

- **Supabase client**: `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` (browser), `.server.ts` (server), `.admin.ts` (RLS bypass).
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth + Google OAuth. Session in middleware.
- **i18n routing**: `src/middleware.ts` rewrites `/{locale}/...`.
- **Incidents**: `submitIncident` server action → PII Guardian → Supabase insert.
- **Ratings**: K-BENCHMARK model scoring via `k_model_scores` MAT view.

# Launch Copy & Community Outreach Templates

This document contains copy templates for launching **ALPAR AI** on technical and founder-focused developer communities: **Hacker News (Show HN)**, **Reddit r/MachineLearning**, and **Reddit r/SaaS**.

## 1. Hacker News — "Show HN" Draft

**Title:** Show HN: ALPAR AI – Open-Source Trust Infrastructure for AI Governance & EU AI Act Compliance

**Body:**

Hi HN,

We built **ALPAR AI** (AGPL-3.0) because existing AI safety and compliance tools are either closed enterprise black-boxes or manual static checklists. With the EU AI Act taking effect, AI developers need an automated, transparent, and developer-first trust layer.

### What is ALPAR AI?

ALPAR AI is an open-source trust and governance framework designed to give engineers runtime oversight, auditability, and compliance enforcement over LLM inputs, outputs, and automated decisions.

### Key Technical Architecture:

- **PII & Data Leak Guardian:** Automated zero-dependency regex and heuristic sanitization (`src/lib/pii/guardian.ts`) that masks PII, corporate secrets, and credential strings before database persistence or third-party provider ingestion.
- **Granular Audit Trails:** Cryptographic hashing and immutability primitives for AI system incidents and algorithmic feedback.
- **Multi-locale Compliance Engine:** Built on Next.js 15 (App Router), Supabase (PostgreSQL with RLS), and Tailwind v4, ensuring sub-100ms audit log processing with full i18n support.
- **Developer-First Mutation Pipeline:** Clean Server Actions mutation model (`src/actions/*`) guaranteeing no unauthenticated client-side database writes.

### Source & Architecture:

- **Repository:** https://github.com/quantummatrixcore-lab/Alparai.com
- **Live Demo:** https://alparai.com

We’d love feedback on:

1. Our PII masking heuristics performance vs ML-based PII detection overhead.
2. RLS policy patterns for high-throughput AI incident logging in Supabase.
3. What edge cases you encounter in EU AI Act alignment for non-deterministic model outputs.

Looking forward to your questions and criticism!

## 2. Reddit — r/MachineLearning Draft

**Title:** [P] ALPAR AI: Open-Source Infrastructure for PII Masking, Algorithmic Auditability, and EU AI Act Governance

**Body:**

Hi r/MachineLearning,

As generative models move into production workloads across Europe and globally, AI engineers face strict regulatory obligations around data leakage, model transparency, and auditability under the EU AI Act.

To address this, we open-sourced **ALPAR AI** (AGPL-3.0), a trust and accountability framework for production LLM pipelines.

### Features & Capabilities:

1. **Runtime PII Scrubbing:** Intercepts and masks sensitive personal identifiers, API keys, and corporate confidential data prior to model invocation or database persistence.
2. **Audit Logging & Incident Verification:** Provides deterministic audit trails for AI system output anomalies, enabling post-hoc inspection of model behavior without storing raw PII.
3. **Open Architecture:** Built using Next.js 15, TypeScript (strict `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`), and Supabase with strict Row Level Security (RLS).

### Benchmark & Performance Focus:

Unlike heavy Python-side middleware that adds multi-hundred millisecond latency to LLM inference pipelines, ALPAR AI executes sanitization and audit dispatch at the edge with minimal CPU overhead.

- **Documentation & Specs:** https://alparai.com/en/documentation

We would appreciate feedback from ML practitioners, MLOps engineers, and security researchers on expanding our heuristic rule engine and synthetic benchmark suites.

## 3. Reddit — r/SaaS Draft

**Title:** How we built an open-source EU AI Act compliance engine for SaaS teams (and why manual checklists don't work)

**Body:**

Hey r/SaaS,

If your SaaS app relies on LLMs or AI automation, you've likely seen the growing compliance pressure from European enterprise buyers and regulators asking about EU AI Act compliance, SOC2 AI controls, and PII protection.

Most SaaS founders handle this with generic PDF checklists or expensive legacy compliance software that doesn't touch actual code. We realized SaaS teams need **code-level infrastructure**, not static questionnaires.

We spent the past few months building and open-sourcing **ALPAR AI** (https://alparai.com).

### The Bottlenecks We Solved for SaaS Builders:

- **Enterprise Procurement Friction:** Buyers want proof that user data isn't leaked to AI providers. ALPAR AI automatically masks PII in free-text inputs before storage or API execution.
- **Audit Readiness:** Every incident, user feedback report, and automated action generates a verifiable audit record.
- **Zero Lock-in:** AGPL-3.0 open-source code base you can self-host or integrate directly into your Next.js/Supabase stack.

### Stack Choice:

- Next.js 15 App Router
- Supabase PostgreSQL + RLS
- Tailwind v4 & next-intl (EN/TR)

We’d love to hear how other SaaS founders are currently handling AI compliance requests from enterprise clients, and what tooling features would save you the most developer hours.

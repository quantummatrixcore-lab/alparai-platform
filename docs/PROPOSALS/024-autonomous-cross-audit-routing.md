# PROPOSAL 024: Autonomous Cross-Audit & Trust-Based Routing (Admin Only)

## 1. The Vision: AI Auditing AI (First-Mover Advantage)
Currently, there is no commercial platform that dynamically routes AI requests based on real-time, self-generated "Trust & Ethics" scores derived from a multi-agent debate (Cross-Audit) system. 

This proposal introduces a self-regulating architecture where ALPAR AI's proprietary Cross-Audit engine evaluates free-tier models (Llama, DeepSeek, Qwen) against each other. Based on their performance, hallucination rates, and ethical compliance (K-Benchmark), the system autonomously reorganizes its internal routing chains to always favor the most reliable and cost-effective (free) models.

## 2. Stealth Execution (Internal Admin-Only Scope)
**CRITICAL:** This feature must remain strictly internal (Admin Panel only).
Exposing the Cross-Audit mechanism and live comparative scoring publicly poses a severe risk of intellectual property theft. Mega-providers (OpenRouter, Nvidia, Google) possess the capital and infrastructure to immediately replicate this "Autonomous Trust Routing" if it is exposed. 

Therefore:
- The Cross-Audit engine runs silently in the background or via the `/admin` dashboard.
- It consumes **Free-Tier** APIs exclusively to generate comparative analysis without inflating costs.
- Public users only see the *results* (the final accountability reports), never the multi-agent debate or the routing logic that generated them.

## 3. Mechanism of Action

### A. Live Discovery & Filtering
- A background cron job fetches live model lists from our 6 integrated providers (OpenRouter, Nvidia NIM, Google, Cohere, HuggingFace, Blackbox).
- Models are filtered by pricing (`prompt: $0`, `completion: $0`) to isolate the "Free-Tier Arsenal".

### B. The Internal Cross-Audit Arena (The Triage)
- When a complex incident or data analysis task arrives in the Admin Panel, it is not sent to a single expensive model (e.g., Claude 3.5).
- Instead, it is routed to the `CROSS_AUDIT_ENGINE` which assigns 3 different free models (e.g., Llama 3.3 for logic, Qwen 2.5 for speed, DeepSeek V3 for reasoning).
- The models independently analyze the incident.
- A final "Judge" model (which can be a highly efficient free model or a low-cost premium one) evaluates their responses and synthesizes the truth.

### C. Self-Healing Routing (Proprietary Scoring)
- If a specific model (e.g., Llama 3) consistently hallucinates or fails the Judge's ethical standards during these internal debates, its "ALPAR Trust Score" decreases.
- The Orchestrator automatically demotes this model from the active routing chains and promotes a better-performing free model.
- **Result:** The system continuously self-optimizes for maximum accuracy and minimum cost without human intervention.

## 4. Required Architecture Updates
1. **Database:** 
   - `ai_models` table (syncs with live provider APIs).
   - `ai_routing_chains` table (maps domains like `MATH_LOGIC`, `CREATIVE_COPY` to model IDs).
   - `ai_trust_scores` table (internal ledger of model performance).
2. **Admin UI:**
   - A new dashboard under `/admin/ai-orchestrator` to visualize the live model inventory and the current autonomous routing paths.
3. **Gateway Modification:**
   - `openrouter-gateway.ts` must switch from hardcoded `const` arrays to fetching the active chain from Supabase Redis/Cache.

## 5. Security & IP Protection
- All prompts used in the Cross-Audit Arena must be obfuscated.
- Do not expose the "Judge" verdict logic to the client side.
- Maintain strict RLS on all AI orchestration tables.
